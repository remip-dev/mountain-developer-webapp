# The Build Pipeline is responsible for preparing a production-ready build of the application.
# It validates the code by running tests and ensures the build process completes successfully.
# This pipeline uploads two artifacts: one with a version number for historical reference,
# and another one with the tag 'latest' to be used by the deploy pipeline.

# The pipeline achieves the following steps:
# 1. Checkout the code from the main branch.
# 2. Install the Node.js environment to ensure a consistent environment.
# 3. Install all dependencies needed for the build and tests.
# 4. Format the code using Prettier to maintain code style.
# 5. Build the app, generating the production files in the 'dist' directory.
# 6. Run unit tests to validate the code.
# 7. Generate a version number based on the current timestamp for tracking purposes.
# 8. Upload the build artifact with the version number for historical reference.
# 9. Upload the build artifact as 'latest'.
